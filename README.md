# flutter_portugal_scheduler


This is the root project used in the workshop of Flutter Portugal, a community-driven initiative aimed at teaching and promoting the use of Flutter for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop.

The project is an ongoing effort to provide a comprehensive learning resource for individuals looking to get started with Flutter. It contains the source files, configurations, and other essential components necessary for building a Flutter application.

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using your preferred version control system.
2. Navigate to the root directory of the project in your terminal or command prompt.
3. Run the command `flutter create .` to set up the project and generate the necessary files and configurations.

Note: Running `flutter create .` will overwrite any existing files in the project directory. Make sure to commit any changes you've made to the project before running this command.

By following these steps, you'll be able to get started with the project and begin exploring the world of Flutter development.


## Deployment Instructions
